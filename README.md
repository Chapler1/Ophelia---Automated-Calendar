## 4. Create new project/task
- maybe: before setting new events be prompted to resync with google calenders this will avoid schedule conflits before they happen.
- Collect user information about their event to schedule. 
- Generate and show possible schedules within given paremeters
- Show individual schedules on single press possibly implement a calendar view as well.
  - Show confirmation on single press of 'set' button cancel button goes back to home screen
    - cancel button could possibly prompt to add this configuration to a list of unscheduled tasks that are acessable from settings to be planned later.
